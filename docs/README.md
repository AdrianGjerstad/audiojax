# Documentation

> This page is a stub. If you want to help by adding content to it, fork this project, and make your changes, you should then create a pull request comparing your repository to our `main` branch.

The following content is here to explain the purpose of [`@AdrianGjerstad/audiojax:docs/` directory](https://github.com/AdrianGjerstad/audiojax/tree/main/docs/).

This directory is meant to explain the purpose, use, and signature of classes, structs, and methods within the AudioJAX C++ DSP library.

## Expectations

Whenever an addition to the project's source code, documentation entries should be added inside the addition's pull request before being merged.
